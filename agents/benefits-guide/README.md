## Important Safety & Administrative Disclosures

Benefits Guide is an educational and administrative resource. It does not provide medical diagnoses, clinical advice, or legally binding coverage determinations. Only your health insurance plan can confirm coverage for a specific provider or procedure. Always verify benefits with your insurer prior to scheduled non-emergency treatments.
